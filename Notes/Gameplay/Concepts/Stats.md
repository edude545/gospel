#### Primary stats
- Muscle - Brute strength. Modifies effectiveness of attacks.
- Art - Precision of attacks. High Art facilitates complex attacks like severing body parts or attacking between the ribs.
- Locomotion - Movement speed and agility. Higher Locomotion values allow faster movement and turning.
- Metabolism - Efficiency of metabolic processes. Higher metabolism provides a greater effect from consumable items like stimulants.
- Discipline - Ability to withstand pain.
- Replenishment - Rate at which the body generates blood.
#### Secondary stats
These modify other stats but don't do anything by themselves:
- Consciousness - Provided by the brain. Has a great effect on Art, a slight effect on Locomotion, and an inverse effect on Discipline, i.e. low Consciousness corresponds to high pain tolerance. If Consciousness drops below a certain value, the player falls unconscious.
- Respiration - Ability to breathe. Determines maximum stamina and stamina recovery rate. Caps Consciousness, e.g. if Respiration is at 90%, Consciousness cannot exceed 90%.
- Circulation - Rate of blood circulation. Caps Consciousness.
