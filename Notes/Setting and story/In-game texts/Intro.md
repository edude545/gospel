GENESIS 2:1 - The half-life of the Holy Spirit, measured in trillions of years. God became senile, and the holy trees of Eden withered.

The angels, or megafauna, are believed to have enacted the will of God since time immemorial. RAMIEL impaled primitive humans to form the digestive tract, and URIEL's fire was taken to cook meat.



In modern days, the search for meaning has led people to drastically alter their bodies through surgery. Extreme body modification is commonplace, as people attempt to transfigure themselves into a less profane form.

(Prophet dialogue)

 Angelic visitations often result in mass destruction. The megafauna seen on the horizon shamble inexorably closer to human settlements, and those within prepare to be judged.
 
But Gotten, in all its history, had never received such a visitation. It's a holy sanctuary where God walked.

Years ago, CASSIEL lurched into the city. The recalcitrant angel was defeated and imprisoned in the Church of Saturn.

The work of God is not yet done, though the devout will try to stop your approach. Demonstrate the creature's true immanence. Tear it up and evert its body. Complete the apotheosis. Pull its guts out through its nostrils.
