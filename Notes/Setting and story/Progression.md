The player starts in a cave in the wetland north of [Visgalburg]. (?)

The wetlands are filled with stagnant water and noxious air, making any injuries received here potentially lethal due to risk of infection. Diseases are also extremely common.

To the south is the fishing town of [Visgalburg], where the player can find a pharmacy. NPC dialog directs the player south to [Fisklane].

There,

Fisklane is a disorganized system of old plank bridges, jetties and moored fishing boats where Visgalburg's fishermen work.
