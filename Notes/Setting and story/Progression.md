The player starts in a cave in the [[Hachrecht]] wetland north of [Visgalburg]. (?)

The wetlands are filled with stagnant water and noxious air, making any injuries received here potentially lethal due to risk of infection. Diseases are also extremely common.

To the south is the fishing town of [Visgalburg], where the player can find a pharmacy. NPC dialog directs the player south to [[Fisklane]], and informs them that the journey north to Gotten is dangerous, and they should prepare by buying equipment and medicine.

The player can work at Fisklane, gathering the dead fish that float up from the [[Sea of Nops]] and defending themselves from the hostile entities that roam the jetties. Fish gathered can be traded for medicine in Visgalburg.

Once prepared with an adequate amount of resources, the player can explore Hachrecht. At the end of this area is the camp of an exiled and starving [[Cephalophages|cephalophage]], who attacks the player on sight. This opens the way to the [[Wastes of Ham]], a long, empty area where the player slowly approaches the outskirts of Gotten.

At the end of the Wastes of Ham, the player enters the [[Streets of Gotten]], another hub area with NPC vendors. The Streets are a long mazelike area with several openable shortcuts.

After this area, the player enters Central [[Gotten]] and meets another round of vendors. The [[Church of Saturn]], is accessible from here, where the player can attend [[Dedan]]'s sermon and have a dialogue with him afterward where he summarises the Gospel of Methuselah and his personal belief system. The player may choose to kill Dedan, after which they enter the Church.

The Church is the final and most difficult area, where the player fights several inhabitants of the cathedral's unmapped interior, and the [[Blood eagles|blood eagle]] who is tasked with defending Cassiel's prison. After killing the blood eagle, the player attacks and kills Cassiel, causing the first death of an angel at the hands of a human. After Cassiel has been killed, a second blood eagle enters the room and the player character accepts their death.
