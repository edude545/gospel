The player starts in a cave in the [[Hachrecht]] wetland north of [[Visgalburg]]. The Prophet is introduced as the player's guide.
"WAKE, thou unkempt, moribund beast. Burn the rot off thy joints and return to life. God is not done with thee."

The wetlands are filled with stagnant water and noxious air, making any injuries received here potentially lethal due to risk of infection. Diseases are also extremely common. The Prophet urges the player towards Visgalburg.

To the south is the fishing town of [[Visgalburg]], where the player can find a pharmacy and Erik Hufschmidt's house. The Prophet and NPC dialog directs the player south to [[Fisklane]], and informs them that the journey north to Gotten is dangerous, and they should prepare by buying equipment and medicine.

The player can work at Fisklane, gathering the seafood that floats up from the [[Sea of Nops]] and defending themselves from the hostile entities (mostly crabs) that roam the jetties. Fish gathered can be exchanged for currency in Visgalburg. A cudgel can be found in Fisklane. The player can also buy a backsword from a vendor. Although this weapon isn't effective at killing crabs (which are only vulnerable to blunt-force trauma), it becomes very effective in Hachrecht.
Cudgel description:
"Heavy blunt weapon that allows more powerful strikes.
Blunt-force attacks are often the most effective against enemies that employ armor or protective shells."
Backsword description: "Antique single-edged blade, most effective at cutting attacks. Back edge is bladed near the tip to facilitate thrusting. This weapon can be used to draw blood, or even to sever limbs given a high ART value."

Once prepared with an adequate amount of resources, the player can explore Hachrecht. At the end of this area is the camp of an exiled and starving [[Cephalophages|cephalophage]], who attacks the player on sight. A metal spike can be picked up from the exiled cephalophage's camp, and used as a piercing weapon, allowing the player to utilize their Art stat more effectively. This opens the way to the [[Wastes of Ham]], a long, empty area where the player slowly approaches the outskirts of Gotten.

At the end of the Wastes of Ham, the player enters the [[Streets of Gotten]], another hub area with NPC vendors. The Streets are a long mazelike area with several openable shortcuts.

After this area, the player enters Central [[Gotten]] and meets another round of vendors. The [[Church of Saturn]], is accessible from here, where the player can attend [[Dedan]]'s sermon and have a dialogue with him afterward where he summarises the Gospel of Methuselah and his personal belief system. The player may choose to kill Dedan, after which they enter the Church.

The Church is the final and most difficult area, where the player fights several inhabitants of the cathedral's unmapped interior, and the [[Blood eagles|blood eagle]] who is tasked with defending Cassiel's prison. After killing the blood eagle, the player attacks and kills Cassiel, causing the first death of an angel at the hands of a human. After Cassiel has been killed, a second blood eagle enters the room and the player character accepts their death.
