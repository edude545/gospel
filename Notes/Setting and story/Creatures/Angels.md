The angels, also called megafauna, are creatures of great and terrible power that are believed to serve God. They do not constitute a species, and each individual is totally unique. Angels are not known to reproduce.

Angels are equally worshipped and feared by humans, and appear often in their myths. Angelic visitations, where an angel approaches human civilisation, are dreaded as times of violent spiritual reckoning.
