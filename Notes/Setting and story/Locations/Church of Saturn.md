The grand cathedral at the center of [[Gotten]], where the preacher [[Dedan]] gives sermons. The recalcitrant [[Angels|angel]] [[Cassiel]] was imprisoned here after its attack on Gotten.

Like the rest of Gotten's architecture, the cathedral was built organically with no deliberate design or oversight. As such, faith in God is required to navigate it.
