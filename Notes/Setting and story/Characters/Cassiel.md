An angel that in the recent past attacked the city of Gotten.

Angelic visitations often result in mass destruction, but Gotten, in all its history, had never received such a visitation. The city is unique among human settlements as it was built on a holy site designated by God, and was believed for a long time to be a holy sanctuary where angelic visitations could not occur.

Cassiel's attack was interpreted as the angel straying from God's will by trespassing upon His land, and so it was attacked and imprisoned in the [[Church of Saturn]].
