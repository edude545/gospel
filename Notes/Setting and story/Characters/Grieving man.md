Just outside the city of Gotten, there is a man driven mad by the death of his mother, who has moved into a house he has always admired by himself, neglecting his wife and child. The house is filled with mold and leaks. The player is led to believe that his wife is the one who died, with pictures of the wife and repeated references to "her" death. The house is located in a side-area of the wetlands, and the player is expected to first reach it while exploring the wetlands for the first time. Later, a shortcut can be opened from Gotten into the house area, leading the player to revisit.
## First visit
The house is old, dilapidated and musty, and mold can be seen in some areas. It's a large house, but it's clear that whoever owned it previously was keen to sell it.

> Hello. Welcome to my home.
> What? Haven't you seen a [beauty cyst] before? It's a mark of grief. It appears on people after losing a loved one.
> Yes, I am grieving. But by moving into this house, I am turning over a new leaf. We always admired this place, and it is the perfect place for me to remember her for years to come.
> You can look around if you like. Just don't go into the master bedroom.
> The timepiece belonged to my wife. It was the only thing of hers I was able to take with me to the new house. Everything else had to stay behind.
> Oh, why couldn't she be here with me? My dear wife.
## Second visit
The mold has gotten worse. Some objects are in different places, but the furniture is mostly unmoved. Many old "keepsakes" are displayed. This is the player's first clue as to what's actually happening, as he said previously that the only thing he was able to take from his wife's house was the timepiece.

> Hello again. Do you remember me? You kindly visited a while ago.
> I have been redecorating with some of her old keepsakes. This house is truly my life. It is finally starting to feel lived-in.
> When I close my eyes, I can imagine that we have been living here together for years.
> By the way, do you detect that peculiar scent in the air? I'm not sure where in the house it's coming from... but it's rather pleasant.
## Third visit
The mold is extremely bad, and has taken over much of the house. Parts of it are unnavigable. There is no mold around the timepiece, and it is clearly visible. The mold is worst around the door to the master bedroom, which is slightly ajar. An enormous pile of mold can be seen on the right side of the bed.

> Oh. Welcome back.
> I'm afraid my cyst has gotten worse since you last visited.
> Don't worry, it's nothing deadly. I just have trouble moving around the house now.
> Could I... ask you for a favor? I seem to have lost my timepiece. It's a very precious thing to me. Could you search the house for it?
###### Bringing him the timepiece:
> You have the timepiece? Where is it?
> In your hands...? I can't seem to see it. It must have turned to dust a while ago.
> Oh well. I suppose there's nothing to do.
## Visit to the grieving man's wife
She lives in a much smaller dwelling in the streets of Gotten.
###### Without the timepiece:
> Who are you?
>  I live here with my child. Do you have business with me?
> Don't cause me trouble.
###### With the timepiece:
> Why the fuck do you have that clock? Are you in cahoots with my husband? Give it to me.
> I'm not living in that dump with him, if that's what you've come to ask. I have enough work on my hands as it is.
> He's been useless ever since his mother died and that tumor started growing on his head.
> He became obsessed with that house, because his mother said it looked nice once.
> I said I wasn't going to move there with him, so he just left one day, leaving me with the child. He must have snuck away with the clock.
> It's quite precious, so I can sell it now. Thank you for bringing it to me.
> Could I ask one thing, if you're ever going to return to that place?
> Burn it down.
> Nothing good can come out of that house. Best case scenario, it'll finally drive him out and force him to deal with the situation like an adult.
> I'm not sure if it even will burn, it's so damp. But it's the only way to get rid of that vortex of grief.
## Fourth visit
When the player visits the house after giving the timepiece to the man's wife, it has been entirely consumed by mold and cannot be entered. The player can set fire to it, causing the entire building to ignite at once.
## Fifth visit
When the player visits the area after setting fire to the house, there is just an empty field with a small mound where the house used to be.
