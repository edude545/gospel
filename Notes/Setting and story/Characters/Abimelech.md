#### Abimelech's sermon
(Heard by the player when first entering Gotten's sanctuary)

"'[[Ramiel]] saw the opportunity, and he formed of God's thunder a great spear, and he impaled the [[Adamites]], and ran them through. Their bodies were opened to the outside air and their lungs were filled with the noxious breath of Eden.' Thus did the angel Ramiel bring torment to man. The thunder of God sent divine disease into our lungs so that for the first time we could understand the visceral aspect of His creation.

No man in history who has looked into the face of God has done so without fear.

When (prophet) witnessed Heaven's light, he was changed utterly.

"When a person is badly hurt or terrorized, it imprints itself on him, sticking to his mind like a leech and engraving a circuit of resonant pain. For years after, even a faint recall of that memory brings it to life before his eyes.

"Is this phenomenon an example of profane religion? God requires faith of us, but nothing is more readily believable than the pain in one's own body. Physicians have proven scientifically that any man's spirit can be broken.

"The ancient Adamites, being the earthly capillaries of the holy spirit, could not comprehend God's might, for what is a beautiful thing without an eye to behold it? The transformation of primitive man at the hands of the angels was not a punishment, nor a fall from grace, but an act of purest love. Carried out at the behest of the Lord, the profane transfiguration made us lesser than Him, infinitely and forever, and once we became different we were to comprehend His might through the contrast.

"To witness God is to peer into a yawning chasm, to swim downward into a bottomless sea. A countenance of bottomless pain. It is our mode of communion with the Earth.

The mortal frame is a bloody abattoir of violence and beating flesh. If you can't handle that you should just kill yourself.
