A transformation of the arm, promoting runaway muscle growth and changing it into a clumsy but powerful wing-like appendage.

The muscle growth is achieved using a specialised growth hormone. The arm becomes extremely thick and heavy, but the hormone totally destroys the function of the fingers, lengthening them into thick, stiff appendages that comprise half the total length of the arm. For this reason, the procedure is usually only performed on a single arm.

The [[blood eagles]] are known to undergo dual brachial hypertrophization, forsaking the use of their hands. Their name comes from the wing-like appearance of the hypertrophied arms.
