Signature transfiguration of the [[blood eagles]] that facilitates brutal close-quarters violence. Repurposes the ribcage, changing its nature from armor to a weapon.

First, the thorax is cut open and the sternum is removed. The exposed ribs are placed into a mechanical brace and injected with osseotrophin, causing them to straighten and grow outwards over the course of 48 hours. At the end of the procedure the ribs are sharpened to a point and new skin is grafted onto the chest cavity

The procedure results in the sharp scythe-like ribs pointing directly outwards, enabling a fast and deadly close-quarters attack. However, the heart and lungs become extremely vulnerable as a result.

A "partial costafalcic process" may be performed on one half of the ribcage, retaining protection.
