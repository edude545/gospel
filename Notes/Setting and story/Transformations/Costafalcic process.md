Signature transfiguration of the blood eagles that facilitates brutal close-quarters violence. Repurposes the ribcage, changing its nature from armor to a weapon.

First, the thorax is cut open and the sternum is removed. The exposed ribs are placed into a mechanical brace and injected with osseous hypertrophin, causing them to straighten and grow outwards over the course of 48 hours. At the end of the procedure the ribs are sharpened to a point.

The procedure results in the sharp scythe-like ribs pointing directly outwards, enabling a fast and deadly close-quarters attack. However, the heart and lungs become extremely vulnerable as a result.

A "partial costafalcic process" may be performed on one half of the ribcage, retaining protection.
