SETTING
---
Long ago, the primitive Adamites lived under the watchful eye of their god in the Garden of Eden: a paradise where they languished for many aeons. The Adamites never wanted for anything, and never came to harm. Eden was a place of safety, and so the Adamites lacked many features of modern humanity; notably, they were headless. The ancient Adamites needed no eyes to hunt for predators or search for food; they had no mouths, as there was no need to eat. They had no voice to share their inner thoughts, as their spiritual needs were fulfilled through their innate connection to God. Their bodies were bulky and sluggish, and their hands had thousands of fingers, symbolizing their inherent divinity. They lived in Eden for an immeasurable amount of time, but God soon began to die, and the wildlife of Eden withered and rotted. The Adamites were expelled from the garden and underwent a series of drastic transformations at the hands of God's angels, which would prepare them for life without a god.

The parts of the world depicted in the game are dominated by an Abrahamic religion following this creation myth, which is described in an alternate version of the Book of Genesis known as the Gospel of Methuselah. It is named for the longest-lived descendant of the Adamites, who saw humanity as profane and lacking in divinity. He was disgusted by the need for sensory organs and reproduction, and wished to return to Eden; a popular sentiment in contemporary society.

The technology of the modern era has allowed people to surgically transform their bodies in drastic ways. Extreme body modification is commonplace, as people attempt to transfigure themselves into a less profane form.

The Blood Eagles are a religiously-sanctioned monastic order that also serve as a mercenary caste, providing violence-as-a-service to the moneyed devout. They form a unique religious sect that is largely isolated from the rest of society. Inductees into the order receive a specific set of surgical transfigurations, including tarsal reconfiguration, full costafalcic process, orbital excavation and dual brachial hypertrophization. These modifications are performed by members of the sect as a ritual lasting three weeks, and transform inductees into natural predators capable of using their entire body as a weapon.

The cephalophages are a divergent species of humanity, notable as the only ones whose transformations are passed on to their offspring. Due to their extreme biological differences, cephalophages form their own society and religious beliefs, and are generally loathed by baseline humans.
Cephalophages have elongated heads and higher brain volume compared to baseline humanity, with powerful jaws capable of unhinging. They have an extraordinarily efficient metabolism, and are able to go months without food if necessary. However, cephalophages are required once every nine years to consume the head of a living human. This can be either a baseline human or another cephalophage. During the process of consumption, the cephalophages unhinges their jaw around the other's head, then severs the neck with their teeth. Digestion of the head takes place over a few days, during which the eater enters a comatose state. Psychoactive substances released during the digestion of the brain will cause the eater to experience extremely vivid dreams during this period. These dreams can vary in detail, but follow a structure that is shared between all cephalophages.
The biological necessity of head-eating plays an important role in cephalophage culture. It is believed that consuming the head of another and digesting their soul imparts some of the deceased's memories and personality. The religious leader of a community is responsible for selecting a community member to be eaten whenever a cephalophage becomes hungry. More often than not, the selected individual is elderly and near the end of their life. Elderly individuals will usually be eaten by their family members. Criminals will usually be buried or cremated rather than eaten, which is seen as an undesirable fate.
Sometimes, craftsmen and learned individuals who wish to retire will nominate themselves to be eaten by an apprentice, imparting their talent and wisdom onto the next generation. This practice is known as gut-marriage. The apprentice is required to pay a dowry to the family of the eaten, after which they become a member of the family and are expected to support the family through their craft.
Most baseline humans see cephalophages and their cultural practices as abhorrent. Due to their preference to live in isolated, hidden communities, most baseline humans will only ever encounter starving cephalophages who have been exiled from their community, leading to their reputation as savages. There are some documented cases of baseline humans living in cephalophage society.

GAMEPLAY
---
Old-school first-person dungeon crawler gameplay.

The game has a "semi-turn-based" combat system, where NPCs will not act until the player acts. Each attack has a windup time and a cooldown time. When the player chooses an attack to perform, time "resumes" for a duration equal to the attack's windup time, during which enemies may perform attacks of their own. Enemies have a UI element floating over them that indicates their "intent", i.e. the attack they plan to use next and its windup time. This allows the player to strategically select attacks that will complete before the enemy's, and then perform a guard, parry, or evade to protect themselves.

Moving and turning also count as actions. However, moving causes the player to enter a vulnerable state, where attacks from enemies are guaranteed to hit.

The game features a realistic injury system, where once an entity is attacked it sustains an injury to a specific body part, which may bleed, cause pain, or lower the effectiveness of the body part. Players may also catch diseases from dangerous environments, or sustain infections due to poorly-treated injuries.

Stats:
	Muscle - Modifies effectiveness of attacks.
	Art - Precision of attacks. High Art facilitates complex attacks like severing body parts or attacking between the ribs.
	Locomotion - Movement speed and agility. Higher Locomotion values allow faster movement/turning.
	Metabolism - Efficiency of metabolic processes. Higher metabolism provides a greater effect from consumable items like stimulants.
	Discipline - Ability to withstand pain.
	Replenishment - Rate at which the body generates blood.
Sub-stats; these modify other stats but don't do anything by themselves:
	Consciousness - Provided by the brain. Has a great effect on Art, a slight effect on Locomotion, and an inverse effect on Discipline, i.e. low Consciousness corresponds to high pain tolerance. If Consciousness drops below a certain value, the player falls unconscious.
	Respiration - Ability to breathe. Determines maximum stamina and stamina recovery rate. Caps Consciousness, e.g. if Respiration is at 90%, Consciousness cannot exceed 90%.
	Circulation - Rate of blood circulation. Caps Consciousness.

Each attack has an attack power and trauma category. The attack power determines how much damage is done to the target, and how costly the attack is to block. Trauma category determines the type of injury that is inflicted when the attack lands.
- Blunt-force attacks:
	- costly to block
	- most effective at breaking bones (lowering the effectiveness of limbs)
	- effective at inflicting pain
	- can shatter armor
- Cutting attacks:
	- very effective at causing enemies to bleed
	- capable of severing body parts
	- ineffective against armor
- Penetrative attacks:
	- limited bleeding effect
	- can pierce the flesh to damage internal organs
	- normally ineffective against armor, but can bypass it altogether with a high Art stat

PROGRESSION & STORY
---

The player starts in a cave in the wetland north of Visgalburg. (?)

The wetlands are filled with stagnant water and noxious air, making any injuries received here potentially lethal due to risk of infection. Diseases are also extremely common.

To the south is the fishing town of Visgalburg, where the player can find a pharmacy. NPC dialog directs the player south to Fisklane.

Fisklane is a disorganized system of old plank bridges, jetties and moored fishing boats where Visgalburg's fishermen work.
