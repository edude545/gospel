THEME
---
Long ago, the Adamites under the watchful eye of their god in the Garden of Eden: a paradise where they languished for many aeons. The Adamites never wante for anything, and never came to harm. Eden was a place of safety, and so the Adamites lacked many features of modern humanity. Notably, they were headless. The ancient Adamites needed no eyes to hunt for predators or search for food; they had no mouths, as there was no need to eat. They had no voice to share their inner thoughts, as their spiritual needs were fulfilled through their innate connection to God. Their bodies were bulky and sluggish, and their hands had thousands of fingers; a symbol of their inherent divinity. They lived in Eden for an immeasurable amount of time, but God soon began to die, and the wildlife of Eden withered.

GAMEPLAY
---
Old-school first-person dungeon crawler gameplay.

The game has a "semi-turn-based" combat system, where NPCs will not act until the player acts. Each attack has a windup time and a cooldown time. When the player chooses an attack to perform, time "resumes" for a duration equal to the attack's windup time, during which enemies may perform attacks of their own. Enemies have a UI element floating over them that indicates their "intent", i.e. the attack they plan to use next and its windup time. This allows the player to strategically select attacks that will complete before the enemy's, and then perform a guard, parry, or evade to protect themselves.

Moving and turning also count as actions. However, moving causes the player to enter a vulnerable state, where attacks from enemies are guaranteed to hit.

The game features a realistic injury system, where once an entity is attacked it sustains an injury to a specific body part, which may bleed, cause pain, or lower the effectiveness of the body part. Players may also catch diseases from dangerous environments, or sustain infections due to poorly-treated injuries.

Stats:
	Muscle - Modifies effectiveness of attacks.
	Art - Precision of attacks. High Art facilitates complex attacks like severing body parts or attacking between the ribs.
	Locomotion - Movement speed and agility. Higher Locomotion values allow faster movement/turning.
	Metabolism - Efficiency of metabolic processes. Higher metabolism provides a greater effect from consumable items like stimulants.
	Discipline - Ability to withstand pain.
	Replenishment - Rate at which the body generates blood.
Sub-stats; these modify other stats but don't do anything by themselves:
	Consciousness - Provided by the brain. Has a great effect on Art, a slight effect on Locomotion, and an inverse effect on Discipline, i.e. low Consciousness corresponds to high pain tolerance. If Consciousness drops below a certain value, the player falls unconscious.
	Respiration - Ability to breathe. Determines maximum stamina and stamina recovery rate. Caps Consciousness, e.g. if Respiration is at 90%, Consciousness cannot exceed 90%.
	Circulation - Rate of blood circulation. Caps Consciousness.

Each attack has an attack power and trauma category. The attack power determines how much damage is done to the target, and how costly the attack is to block. Trauma category determines the type of injury that is inflicted when the attack lands.
- Blunt-force attacks:
	- costly to block
	- most effective at breaking bones (lowering the effectiveness of limbs)
	- effective at inflicting pain
	- can shatter armor
- Cutting attacks:
	- very effective at causing enemies to bleed
	- capable of severing body parts
	- ineffective against armor
- Penetrative attacks:
	- limited bleeding effect
	- can pierce the flesh to damage internal organs
	- normally ineffective against armor, but can bypass it altogether with a high Art stat
